Changelog
=========

v1.5.5
------

* Improve code formatting
* Add comprehensive inline documentation (Yard)
* Move documentation from gem to it's own homepage, separate content from it's
  own code e.g. we shouldn't have to update the gem each time we update the
  README. This is also good because the only documentation that should go to
  RubyDoc.info is inline (generated by Yard) which sticks with the version that it
  was written for making it easy for someone to refer to documentation for old
  versions.

v1.5.4
------

* Renamed repo from `pesapal-rubygem` to `pesapal-gem` (breaks badge links in old READMEs)
* Write tests

v1.5.3
------

* Fix HTTPS calls throwing Timeout::Error (on production)
* Simplified environment settings (kill :auto)

v1.5.2
------

* Update Gemfile.lock

v1.5.1
------

* Fix bugs, unable to proceed without YAML file
* Require htmlentities

v1.5.0
------

* Remove `path_to_file` second constructor parameter, make constructor simpler
* Remove Rails specific code to Railtie, create fallbacks if using in a non-Rails environment
* Change and improve how credentials are loaded
* Require `net/http`, used by `Net::HTTP` (bug fix)
* Added to travis-ci for continuous integrations
* Added to gemnasium for dependency checking
* Write basic tests

v1.4.0
------

* Makes more sense if mode,@mode variables were env,@env

v1.3.0
------

* Make mode setting should be a bit more intuitive, default more to Rails.env

v1.2.2
------

* Fix `can't modify frozen String` error. Apparently we can't force_encoding on
  a frozen string since that would modify it.

v1.2.1
------

* Fix severe bug caused by buggy (& poorly designed) initializer, which caused
problem for some [as evidenced here on SO][1]

_Ps: Run the install generator (as explained in the docs), if there are any
conflicts, overwrite the initializer only! Or you could just delete the
`config/initializer/pesapal.rb` file and run the generator. Whichever way suits
you._

by then, the demo (in rails) should have been complete.
